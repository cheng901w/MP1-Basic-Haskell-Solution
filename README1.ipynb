    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Part 1:\n",
    "    -   Write recursive functions and definitions.\n",
    "    -   Implement some set-theoretic functionality using Haskell lists.\n",
    "    -   Use higher-order functions to compactly represent common code\n",
    "        patterns.\n",
    "-   Part 2: Use and write Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) with some\n",
    "    associated operators.\n",
    "    -   Manipulate linked lists and simple arithmetic expressions\n",
    "        defined using ADTs\n",
    "    -   Define a binary tree ADT and implement a function on binary\n",
    "        trees.\n",
    "    -   Define a constant value ADT for a simple programming language\n",
    "        and a higher order function to manipulate those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are stuck on some problems, perhaps it’s time to read some of\n",
    "[Learn You a Haskell for Great\n",

    "on Making Your Own Types and Typeclases seem the most relevant. If\n",
    "you’re still stuck on recursion problems, check out Chapter 5 on\n",
    "Recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevant Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In the directory `recursion/src` you’ll find `Lib.hs` with all the\n",
    "relevant code for Part 1. In the directory `adt/src` you’ll find a file\n",
    "of the same name with all the relevant code for Part 2. In each file,\n",
    "the first line `module Lib where` says that what follows (the rest of\n",
    "the file in this case) belongs to the `Lib` module. Haskell has a module\n",
    "system which allows for extensive code re-use. Saying something like\n",
    "`import Data.List` imports the `List` module, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Code\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you have to `stack init` (you only need to do this once):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sh\n",
    "$ stack init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To run your code, start GHCi with `stack ghci`:\n",

    " - more output -\n",
    "Ok, modules loaded: Lib.\n",
    "*Lib>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the test-suite as you fill in the solutions for Part 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following ensures the file will type-check, but the corresponding\n",
    "`myFunction` test will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` haskell\n",
    "myFunction = undefined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 2, you must supply the Algebraic Data Type declarations at the\n",
    "end of the problem-set correctly in order to compile the tests. If you\n",
    "are having trouble with one declaration in particular, use the\n",
    "interpreter to define and debug each ADT individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each part, the test suite is compiled and executed by running\n",
    "`stack test` in the project directory. `recursion` and `adt` for parts 1\n",
    "and 2 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sh\n",
    "$ stack test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will tell you which test-suites you pass, fail, and have exceptions\n",
    "on. To see an individual test-suite (so you can run the tests yourself\n",
    "by hand to see where the failure happens), look in the file\n",
    "`test/Tests.hs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## I Can’t Do Problem X\n",
    "\n",
    "You can ask for help on Piazza or in office hours. If you’re really\n",
    "stuck and don’t have time to fix it, you *must* still put in the type\n",
    "declaration and define it as `undefined` so that it still compiles with\n",
    "our autograder. Not doing so will result in loss of extra points from\n",
    "your total score. Remember that course policy is that code which doesn’t\n",
